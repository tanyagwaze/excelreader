# Automated Evaluation Matrix Analysis
This project is a Python-based automation tool I developed for the University of Houston System (UHS) Internal Audit as a work project.
The program analyzes evaluation matrices for multiple digital signature software solutions (Adobe Sign, DocuSign, DigiCert, Carahsoft, High Emprise) and consolidates the results into a single Excel summary report.

By automating this process, the tool significantly reduced manual reporting time, eliminated calculation errors, and provided the audit department with clear, category-based insights for enterprise-wide decision-making.
